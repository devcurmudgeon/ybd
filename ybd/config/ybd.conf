# YBD is designed to be run from the command line and/or as part of an
# automated pipeline. all configuration is taken from conf files and/or
# environment variables, in the following order of precedence:
#
#    YBD_* environment variables         # if found
#    ./ybd.conf                          # if found
#    $path/to/ybd.py/ybd.conf            # if found
#    $path/to/ybd.py/ybd/config/ybd.conf # default, as provided in the ybd repo
#
# this means you can set custom config via env vars, or the definitions
# top-level directory, or the ybd top-level directory, without having to modify
# the supplied default ybd.conf file.

# NOTE: it is best to create your own ybd.conf file, so you can merge
# new/latest ybd using git with no possibility of a conflict, and your custom
# settings will continue to take precedence.
#
# To set config via environment variables, each must be prefixed with ```YBD_```
# and using ```_``` instead of ```-```. ybd will strip the YBD_ prefix and
# convert ```_``` to ```-```

# These are shortnames for commonly used online git resources - you can alias
# them to use local mirrors

# The artifact algorithm can evolve over time - artifact-version ensures we
# don't accidentally use artifacts from an old/new version in a new/old build.
# You could put a custom value here (eg: FOO1) to ensure your builds can never
# be confused with anyone else's
# Summary of previous artifact-versions:
# Missing: (up to c8af09cbb) the cache_key did not include artifact-version
#                          (now equivalent to setting artifact-version: 0)
# 1: (from 3f9fe8bb onwards) cache_key now includes artifact-version
# 2: (from e36be257 onwards) meta files now include cache-key
# 3: (supported from 934fd7e8be2b4) only include applicable build-system
#    (enabled from 16.17 onwards)
# 4: (after d33e0c8a9) include definitions repo: & ref: in meta for non-chunks
# 5: (after 6c464db0ce) 'path' field no longer includes '.morph'

# path to be used in default chroots for builds
base-path: ['/usr/bin', '/bin', '/usr/sbin', '/sbin']

# historically we have not been great at ensuring definitions don't contain
# wrong names etc. ybd can react to this via the check-definitions parameter.
# possible values are 'ignore', 'warn', 'exit'
check-definitions: 'warn'

# If two components both offer a version of one file in the target system
# then the behaviour may be different depending on which version is installed
# last. ybd can react to this via the check-overlaps parameter.
# possible values are 'ignore', 'warn', 'exit'
check-overlaps: 'warn'

# cleanup failed builds. Note: if this is set to False, tmpdir will fill up
cleanup: True

# where to look for definitions defaults if none found in definitions
defaults: 'config/defaults.conf'

# Splitting is our name for installing a subset of files from an artifact.
# By default we just install everything, to optimise on build speed.
# default-splits: ['-minimal', '-runtime', '-devel'] would give the same set
# of files, but installation takes longer
# If you want runtime systems only, add the following to your ybd.conf
# default-splits: ['-minimal', '-runtime']

# You can override any of the directories that ybd uses
# 'base' specifies ybd's top level working directory - by default the other
# directories are found under it, but you can set them to full paths, e.g.
# base: /src and artifacts: /nfsmount/artifacts
directories:
  # where ybd saves/finds built artifacts
  'artifacts':

  # top-level default for ybd workings if other directories are not specified
  # all the other directories are under base, unless specified as full path

  # where ccache results are saved

  # working directory for deployments

  # where sandboxes and other tmp directories are created
  'tmp':

  # where aboriginal workers will work (in future)
  'workers':

# Number of instances to run in parallel on many-core systems
# Testing suggests that parallelizing an individual build only makes sense
# up to about 8-10 cores, so after that running more instances is better.
# if instances is not specified, YBD will choose for itself
# instances:

# Where to look for schema if none found in definitions
json-schema: './schema/json-schema.json'

# Password for uploading artifacts to kbas. NOTE: kbas code expressly rejects
# 'insecure' as a password so this *must* be changed to get it to work
kbas-password: 'insecure'

# by default we only upload 'chunk' artifacts to kbas - alternatively set to
# some/all of ['chunk', 'stratum', 'system']
kbas-upload: ['chunk']

# Where to look for artifacts already built by other instances of YBD
kbas-url: 'http://artifacts1.baserock.org:8000/'

# log-timings (previously this was log-elapsed)
# - 'elapsed' (default) show time since the start of the run
# - 'normal' to show wallclock timestamps
# - 'omit' no timestamps - makes it easier to diff one log with another
log-timings: 'elapsed'

# Set log-verbose: True to get extra log info for debugging ybd... runs slower
log-verbose: False

# Max-jobs controls the maximum number of threads for build-steps.

# ybd will default it to number-of-cores, up to a moximum of 10
# max-jobs:

# YBD can output a manifest containining {name, cache_key, repo, ref, sha, md5}
# The options are
# - 'False': no manifest
# - 'True': create manifest at ./<target>.manifest
# - or path/to/manifest/filename. if filename does not end with .text,
#   output will be json
manifest: False

# YBD will automagically cull artifacts to ensure there is enough space to run.
# if you don't want any artifacts to be culled, set this to zero.
min-gigabytes: 10

# Possible modes are
# - parse-only (stops after dumping parsed definitions)
# - keys-only (stops after cache-keys have been calculated)
# - no-build (runs all the way through, but creates empty artifacts)
# - normal (parses definitions into cache-keys, builds artifacts, may deploy)
mode: normal

no-ccache: False
no-distcc: True

# if release-note is specified, ybd will create a list of changes
# since the `release-since` ref or the last tag in the current checkout
release-note: './release-note.txt'

# release-since can be any ref in the definitions history
# if release-since is not specified, ybd will default to use the last tag.
