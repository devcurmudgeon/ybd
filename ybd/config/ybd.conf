# ybd is designed to be run from the command line and/or as part of an
# automated pipeline. all configuration is taken from conf files and/or
# environment variables, in the following order of precedence:
#
#    YBD_* environment variables         # if found
#    ./ybd.conf                          # if found
#    $path/to/ybd.py/ybd.conf            # if found
#    $path/to/ybd.py/ybd/config/ybd.conf # default, as provided in the ybd repo
#
# this means you can set custom config via env vars, or the definitions
# top-level directory, or the ybd top-level directory, without having to modify
# the supplied default ybd.conf file.

# NOTE: it is recommendeded to create your own ybd.conf file, so you can merge
# new/latest ybd using git with no possibility of a conflict, and your custom
# settings will continue to take precedence.
#
# to set config via environment variables, each must be prefixed with ```YBD_```
# and using ```_``` instead of ```-```. ybd will strip the YBD_ prefix and
# convert ```_``` to ```-```, for example
